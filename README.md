# Travaux Pratiques pour Algorithmique Générale

This repository documents the work that I've done for a general introduction to data structures and algorithms.

## TP1

This TP focused on analyzing complexity and learning a practical application of big O notation by comparing the complexity of different partition schemes for quicksort.

## TP2

A high-level API overview can be found [here](https://polytech-sorbonne-main-tp2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), while more technical details generated with Doxygen can be found [here](https://ejovo13.github.io/DSA_TP1/)

This TP contained problems dealing with graphs, and various other data types like stacks and queues used to support numerous graph procedures. Main topics consist of depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)
